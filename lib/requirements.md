Name: Fleeting Offers App

Description: Its an app that will help the users too see all the sales and offers going on in their area and city. this app has a map that shows all the offers near that area. they can press them to see details and get directions. they can search for offers in the search box and they will see a list. for that list they can see details and get direction.

Details about implementation:
I have implemented the map and the search box only. now in the first part we have to implement the other things.

Steps:

1. first implement the pointers in the map. the pointers will be custom and there will be logo in the pointer. later we will get the pointers from api but now keep static dummy data.
2. after that if the user clicks the in one of the pointers, a stack modal will open up that will show the details of that brand. they can see that offer details and there will be a button to get the direction from the users current location to that place. (if in an emulator we cannot get the device location, set a fixed point as the user location for now and show that on the maps as the user location)
3. do this things properly and then we will proceed with the other functionalities.
